Released in April 2021, Flight Studies was created as part of a coordinated NFT release uniting more than thirty-five leading digital artists in support of #CleanNFT. A movement advocating for the migration of digital art toward low-energy, environmentally responsible blockchain platforms.

Flight Studies art works are displayed on custom made digital frames, build from repurposed e-waste and reimagined as a minimalist object of contemplation.

The series is generated through custom GLSL shader code and takes inspiration from the pre-cinematic motion studies of Eadweard Muybridge. Algorithmically produced chromatic aberrations, synthetic rather than optical, function as both aesthetic strategy and conceptual lens. They point to attention as a double-edged force: a means of intensification and revelation, but also one of capture, extraction, and control.

More than a century after Muybridge's investigations into motion, contemporary image-making is deeply entangled with infrastructures of consumption and resource extraction. Proof-of-work cryptocurrency systems heighten this tension, embedding ecological cost within acts of circulation and display. In Flight Studies, the gaze is subtly redirected back toward the viewer. Our appetite for images, data, and uninterrupted visual flow emerges as both generative desire and latent threat. Like birds in open flight, we often move freely while remaining unaware of the invisible systems that shape, and constrain, our possible trajectories.

## Upcycled Displays

Extending the ecological ethos of the work into its physical presentation, Flight Studies is exhibited on bespoke digital frames constructed from repurposed electronic waste. Obsolete LCD screens are diverted from landfills and reconfigured as minimalist display objects, transforming discarded technology into contemplative viewing instruments.

Drawing inspiration from the anti-industrial principles of the Arts and Crafts movement, these frames combine metal, wood, and software into hybrid artifacts. Craftsmanship, sustainability, and digital media converge to produce an object with its own material presence, one that foregrounds care, longevity, and environmental responsibility alongside the immaterial circulation of the NFT itself.

## The FEN

This series of works was produced for [The FEN](http://thefen.io), a coordinated CleanNFT drop initiated by curator [Juliette Bibasse](https://julietteb.com/), visual artist [Joanie Lemercier](https://joanielemercier.com/) and more than 35 pioneering digital media artists in response to the outrageous greenhouse-gas emissions of CryptoArt releases on the Ethereum blockchain (PoW).

Our goal was to encourage the community to transition their NFTs to a low-energy platform, such as hic et nunc (Tezos Blockchain, PoS). Minting an NFT on hic et nunc has associated emissions equivalent to an email.

As part of this project, [The FEN](http://thefen.io) invited each creative to donate 10% of the proceeds to a project of their choice (local project, NGO, activism, etc..).
