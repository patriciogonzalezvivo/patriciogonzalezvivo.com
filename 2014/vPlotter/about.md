## vPlotter

### 1.Basic principes 

The vPlotter is essentially a vertical drawing machine that consist on a sharpie suspended between to motors which moves it over a wall surface.

The maths involves on the movement of the sharpie over the surface is extremely simple. It require to know the distance between the motors to calculate how much string distance each motor have to give to the sharpie (plotter head). This distance could be calculated using Pythagorus' theorem.

![GRAPH](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/2013/labs/amsterdam/class_15_machinedesign/drawing-1.png)

Both motors are attached to the wall at the same height to the floor separated by a given distance. The more distance there is between them, the more bigger area to draw we have. I usually separate the motors by 1.5 meters (1500 mm). 

	distance_between_motors = 1500;

So the motors position could be represented as: 

	M1.x = 0;
	M1.y = 0;

	M2.x = M1.x + distance_between_motors;		// 1500
	M2.y = 0;

Knowing this we can calculate the position of the plotter head using Pythagorus' theorem. We can imagen triangle composed by the two motors and the plotter head as to right triangles. For each motor we need to find the distance (square root) to the sharpie. By releasing this amount of string to the plotter head gravity will make the rest tensing the string.

	distance.M1 = square_root( M1.x*M1.x + M1.y*M1.y );
	distance.M2 = square_root( M2.x*M2.x + M2.y*M2.y );

To have precise control on the motors movements, I'm using two [NEMA 17 steppers motors](https://ultimachine.com/content/kysan-1124090-nema-17-stepper-motor) controlled with a [Pololu A4988 Stepper Driver](https://ultimachine.com/content/pololu-a4988-stepper-driver-heatsink-kit) each one. 

[![nema17](images/nema17.png)](https://ultimachine.com/content/kysan-1124090-nema-17-stepper-motor) 

Nema 17 motors have 200 steps for rotation but by enabling quarters of steps on the Pololu drivers we can obtain up to 800 steps for rotation which means tons more of precision. Next we need to calculate the circumference of the pulleys to calculate how many millimeters we have for step. In my case I'm using two [Timing Pulley GT2 of 20 tooth](https://ultimachine.com/content/timing-pulley-gt2-20-tooth) which have a bore of 5mm and match the [GT2 Timing Belt](https://ultimachine.com/content/timing-belt-gt2-custom-length) that holds the plotter header. From that we can calculate the amount of step using this formulas:

	STEPS = 800;
	DIAMETER = 5; // 5mm
	CIRCUMFERENCE = DIAMETER * PI; // 15.7 mm
	m2s = CIRCUMFERENCE / STEPS; // 0.019625 mm for step

Keeping track of how much string each motor have move we can estimate with a precision of 0.019625mm the position of the plotter header. I'm keeping track of the number of steps given and the once needs to be taken in structured variables call MotorVal :

	struct MotorVal{
  	  long M1;
    	long M2;
	};

 To calculate the plotter drawing head we can use absolute parameters or relative. This means the an absolute position or a position relative to the previous one. In order to have accurate absolute positions is necessary to know the starting position of the plotting head. For that I use a physical mark on the center of the drawing area to manually adjust the plotter header at the beginning of each drawing work. Other drawing machines likes laser cutters or CNC machines have sensors to estimate the initial position.

Another important feature of this drawing machine is the ability to start and stop drawing by moving the sharpie close or further the wall surface. This is done using a [Micro Servo Motor](http://www.adafruit.com/products/169) mounted on the plotter heads. Servo's use frequency of pulse to calculate the angle of the motor. They can go from -90 to 90 (0 - 180 deg) alternating between 544 to 2400 pulses per second. Buy moving the sharpie away or towards the surface we can define when is drawing lines and when is just moving. This together with the absolute or relative coordinates define 4 types of commands.

	enum Command{
  	  MOVE_ABS = 0,
    	MOVE_REL,
    	LINE_ABS,
    	LINE_REL
	};

Using this commands each line of a drawing is translated to instructions to the motors. 

	void vPlotter::print(vector<ofPolyline> _paths){
		for(int i = 0; i < _paths.size(); i++) {
			for(int j = 0; j < _paths[i].getVertices().size(); j++){
				addInstruction( ((j==0)?MOVE_ABS:LINE_ABS), _paths[i].getVertices()[j] );
			}
		}
		addInstruction(MOVE_ABS, printingArea.getCenter());
	}

	bool vPlotter::addInstruction(Command _command, ofPoint _pos){
		ofPoint t;

		//  ABSolute or RELative positions??
		//
		switch (_command) {
			case MOVE_ABS:
			case LINE_ABS:
				t = _pos;
				break;
			case MOVE_REL:
			case LINE_REL:
				t = _pos + currentPos;
				break;
		}

		//  Make instruction
		//
		Instruction inst;
		inst.set(_pos);
		inst.cmd = _command;
		inst.target = getStepsFor(_pos);

		//  Add
		//
		instructions.push_back(inst);
	}

	MotorVal vPlotter::getStepsFor(ofPoint _pos) {
		MotorVal val;
		val.M1 = M1.distance(_pos)/m2s;
		val.M2 = M2.distance(_pos)/m2s;
		return val;
	}

To ensure consistency, I'm adding an extra instruction that move the head of the plotter to the center of the printing area. This prevent the user to move manually the head of the plotter to physical mark on the center of the plotting area.

This instructions then are been processed in another threat sending to each motor how many number of steps have to move and in what direction. Controlling real motors imply been subscript to real behavior, that means been aware of the physical stress (thermal and electrical) together with the time a task takes to be executed. Following you can see the function that executes the instructions, how the calculate pauses and the pulses to the motors. 

	void vPlotter::threadedFunction(){
		while( isThreadRunning() != 0 ){
			if (isPrinting()){
				if(getInstructionsLeft()){
					if (exeInstruction(instructions[0])){
						if(lock()){
							instructions.erase(instructions.begin());
							unlock();
						}
					}
				} else {
					bPlotting = false;
					stopThread();
				}
			}
		}
	}

	bool vPlotter::exeInstruction(Instruction _inst){
		MotorVal t, s;
		float sd,pd;

		//  Set the right PEN
		//
		sd = stepDelay*1000.0f;
		pd = penDelay*1000.0f;
		switch (_inst.cmd) {
			case LINE_REL:
			case LINE_ABS:{
				if(penState == PEN_UP){
					softServoWrite(SERVO_PIN,penPosDown);
					usleep(pd);
				}
				penState = PEN_DOWN;
				break;
			}
			case MOVE_REL:
			case MOVE_ABS:{
				if(penState == PEN_DOWN){
					softServoWrite(SERVO_PIN,penPosUp);
					usleep(pd);
				}
				penState = PEN_UP;
				break;
			}
		}

		// Tmp Variables
		t = target = _inst.target;
		s = steps;
    
		// set directions
		MotorVal dir;
		dir.M1 = (t.M1 > s.M1) ? +1 : -1;
		dir.M2 = (t.M2 > s.M2) ? +1 : -1;
		digitalWrite(DIR_PIN_M1, (t.M1 > s.M1) ? DIR_UP : DIR_DOWN);
		digitalWrite(DIR_PIN_M2, (t.M2 > s.M2) ? DIR_DOWN : DIR_UP);

		//  Make steps
		//
		while (s!=t){
			if( t.M1 - s.M1 != 0){
				digitalWrite(STEP_PIN_M1, HIGH);
				s.M1 += dir.M1;
			}

			if(t.M2-s.M2 != 0){
				digitalWrite(STEP_PIN_M2, HIGH);
				s.M2 += dir.M2;
			}

			steps = s;
			currentPos = getPosFor(s);
			usleep(250);
			digitalWrite(STEP_PIN_M1, LOW);
			digitalWrite(STEP_PIN_M2, LOW);
			usleep(250);
			usleep(sd);
		}
		return true;
	}

	//	Reverse kinematics
	//
	ofPoint vPlotter::getPosFor(MotorVal _steps) {
		float a = _steps.M2 * m2s;
		float b = _steps.M1 * m2s;
		float c = motorsDistance;
		return calcPointB(a, b, c);
	}

	ofPoint vPlotter::calcPointB(float a, float b, float c){
		double angle = acos((b*b+c*c-a*a)/(2*b*c));
		return ofPoint(b*cos(angle)+M1.x,b*sin(angle)+M1.y);
	}

This functions are just the core operations behind the drawing. To make the vPlotter a proper tool I design a reliable and flexible infrastructure based on openFrameworks (C++) and Node (JS) on top a Linux OS running on a raspberryPi.

RaspberryPi is a small and cheap board capable of running a complete Linux system on it designed by Eben Upton, Rob Mullins, Jack Lang and Alan Mycroft at the University of Cambridgeâ€™s Computer Laboratory. They envision this board as an educative tool for children by offering the possibility to easily incorporate it on an infinite variety of DIY projects thanks to a series of GPIOs (General Purpose Inputs and Outputs) and expansion slots for HD cameras. In the last year, this device has grabbed the attention of different creative and maker communities such as Scratch, PureData and openFrameworks. It has become a popular device not only for hobbyist and educational projects, but also as a host to new media art and interactive installations.

Because of this versatility and low cost, I chose the RaspberryPi as the perfect device to hold my creative tools. Following Mark Weiser's vision of what he call _"ubiquitous computing"_ each tool will be an autonomous agent capable of work together with other devices through a wireless network. This conform eventually conform an ecosystem of interconnected devices designed to blend into an environment to the point of becoming invisible to the user, while at the same time, assist humans during the creative process.

As I mention before the RaspberryPi have some General Input's and Outputs (GPIO) that will let us connect this board to the stepper motors drivers (Pololu) and the mini servo motors.

![Electronic Board](images/electronic.jpg)

Because the servo use frequency of pulses It will use the GPIO number 18 that have PWM capabilities. For the two motor drivers we use the GPIOs 4, 17, 23 and 22. Each driver will require both a _step_ and a _direction_ pulse to know when and who to make the rotation. This values can be modify on top of the `vPlotter.h` file

	#define SERVO_PIN 18

	#define STEP_PIN_M1 4
	#define DIR_PIN_M1 17

	#define STEP_PIN_M2 23
	#define DIR_PIN_M2 22

### 3.Software

The RaspberryPi use a derived version of Debian Linux distribution as operative system. What is known as Linux OS consist on the conjunction of two projects: GNU software (open source programs) and  Linux Kernel ( the software in-charge of communicating with the hardware). Linux OS born as an open version of Unix OS witch was designed by AT&T to run their Servers. This software architecture is famous for it stability, security and modularity. Each new program install into the computer become part of a robust ecosystem of applications that can be re-combined in different was.

In the case of the vPlotter the C++ code wrote using openFrameworks constitute the core application capable of been executed directly from the command line as follows:

	vPlotter -i file.svg

Also is posible modify some setup parameters like the distance between motors by doing:

	vPlotter -d 2000 -i file.svg

This application not only can print vector files (known as SVG format) but also can listen for instructions on a OSC port (for example the port 1010101).

	vPlotter -o 101010

Another feature of this applications is the possibility of receiving some visual feedback of the instructions on the pull by adding the option -x

	vPlotter -x -o 1010101
	vPlotter -x -i file.svg

It's possible to combine vPlotter to other tools using Unix pipe commands like this: 

	potrace -s image.png || vPlotter -i

In this case we are using the program ['potrace'](http://potrace.sourceforge.net/) to transform an image to vectors (-s) to then print it using vPlotter. Using similar techniques is possible to transform a picture of a document to text to then assign some style and fonts to then vectorize and finally print with the plotter. The combinations are infinite.

But not all user are confortable running linux commands as part of their creative practice. That's why I design a Node.js server that provides an web API to administrate calls to the vPlotter. In any time users can ask for jobs in the plotter queue together with the setup parameters by making a call to `rpi.local:8080/status.json`. Using the same API users can `add` task to the queue or change the setting options of the vPlotter. An hypothetical user with medium knowledge on HTML/CSS/JS can use the plotter remotely sending and receiving calls to this API.

![Modular design of the vPloter](images/diagram.png)

Once again, it's highly possible that the user have the technical knowledge to use the API that's why I also incorporate on the server a web site from witch is possible to drag&drop files to the queue. With this I design a tool that could be access from a big spectrum of architectural layers.

#### Software Installation

1. In order to compile and install the vPlotter binaries in the right place you will need to [install openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/setup/raspberrypi/Raspberry-Pi-Getting-Started.html). For that please follow [this guide](http://openframeworks.cc/setup/raspberrypi/Raspberry-Pi-Getting-Started.html). Be prepared, is going to take a while.

2. Once you have your openFrameworks installed and working (please check it compiling some of the examples), clone this repository inside the `/home/pi/openframeworks/apps` folder.

~~~
	cd ~/openFrameworks/apps
	git clone https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/vPlotter
~~~

5. The last step is to run the installation script which will install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) for the server, [WiringPi](https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/) to comunicate through the GPIOs, compile `vPlotter` and install `vPlotterServer` as a local daemon.

~~~
	cd ~/openFrameworks/apps/vPlotter
	./install.sh
~~~

### 4.Precedents & research

Wall Plotter have been around for a while. My work is mostly continuing what other ones have started. The first documented wall-plotter was develop by [Jurg Lehni]((http://juerglehni.com), and was call [Hektor](http://juerglehni.com/works/hektor/). Jurg is a fascinating artist really committed to tool making, specially related to drawing.

[![Hektor by Jurg Lehni](http://juerglehni.com/thumbs/a804659b633f602eebe228553af0ba16.960.0.0.0.80.jpg)](http://juerglehni.com/works/hektor/)

In my case I start working based on [Alexander Weber](http://tinkerlog.com/) wall plotter call [Kritzler](http://tinkerlog.com/2011/09/02/der-kritzler/). He have done an amazing work documenting the process together with comprenhansable [code](https://github.com/tinkerlog/Kritzler). This version is designed to run with an Arduino plugged to a computer. My first efforts in this projects was porting the code to openFrameworks to then compile and run on the RaspberryPi, but the basic core logics behind the algorithmic kinematics are still pretty much the same as Alex wrote.

[![Kritzler by Alexander Weber](http://tinkerlog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/b_img-1956.jpg)](http://tinkerlog.com/2011/09/02/der-kritzler/)

While I was experimenting with the Plotter I rapidly discover how important is to calculate the right printing area. The variations on the tensions on the string that holds the plotter head is vital to obtain good results on the marker traces.

Doing some research I found some valuable documentation on [this website](http://2e5.com/plotter/V/design/) of how to obtain both resolution and tension coefficient. Since them are presented in Python I translate them into C++ and added to some methods and functions that calculate the best area given a specific distance between the motors.

[![Printing Area](http://2e5.com/plotter/V/design/vPlotterMap.png)](http://2e5.com/plotter/V/design/)

The presence of mathematics concept on drawings have a long history. The laws of perspective and proportions have been one of the first technical tools we use. In my process of making a drawing machine I learn how them connect and work together with physics and mechanical principles. Like Russians Dolls the knowledge embed in a tools is passed in the what the apparatus been constructed by it. At the end, tools become an extension of our body expanding our perception and expressive capabilities because they are constructed and shaped by the tissue of our imagination.

Sometimes drawing tools doesn't born from a long history of techniques and apparatus. They are discovered as the repurpose of everyday machines this is the case of the drawings made by [Echo Yang](http://www.junk-culture.com/2014/02/designer-transforms-old-school-analog.html#more).

[![Echo Yang's drawing machine](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VSzsgancGos/Uw8_8qaYSpI/AAAAAAAAgJ4/djprbHiZl30/s1600/Machines3.jpg)](http://www.junk-culture.com/2014/02/designer-transforms-old-school-analog.html#more)

There are other examples of drawing machines, once that formulates a question not about the tools but about the user. This are the case of sophisticated robots armed with regular brushes and analog paint. These robots mimic our use of this tools in the search of becoming autonomous agents. [eDavid](http://www.informatik.uni-konstanz.de/en/edavid/news/) designed by Oliver Deussen and Thomas Lindemeier is an example of a machine that performs accurate drawings while the robot design by [Benjamin Grosser](http://bengrosser.com/projects/interactive-robotic-painting-machine/) explores into some "expressive" visual representation of sound.
