Point Cloud City is part of [_Skylines_](http::/www.patriciogonzalezvivo.com/2014/skylines), a series of projects about awareness. It is about the tools and techniques we use to see the world around us.

Part of an ongoing [process](http://www.patriciogonzalezvivo.com/2014/skylines/process.php) of investigation during my last year as a Parson's MFA DT student and it was presented as postcards revealing the invisible information of a city that is otherwise trapped inside corporate databases, freeing private information collected from public spaces.
