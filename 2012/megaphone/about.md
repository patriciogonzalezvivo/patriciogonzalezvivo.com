###### Interactive Installation + Building Projection 

For the GLOW festival in Eindhoven, [YESYESNO](http://www.yesyesno.com/megaphone/) created an oversize megaphone that allows you to shout at a building across the street and paint it. &nbsp;We had several scenes that focused on writing and text -- a swirling pile of papers that your voice levitates, an abstract typeface and individual letterforms.
