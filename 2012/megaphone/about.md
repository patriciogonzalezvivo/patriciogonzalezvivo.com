### The Megaphone

##### Interactive Installation + Building Projection 

For the GLOW festival in Eindhoven, we created an oversize megaphone that allows you to shout at a building across the street and paint it. &nbsp;We had several scenes that focused on writing and text -- a swirling pile of papers that your voice levitates, an abstract typeface and individual letterforms.
