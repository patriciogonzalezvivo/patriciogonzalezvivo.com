			<p>There are games that require very little. Sometimes ... only other to play with.</p>
			<p>Playing width shadows is one of the oldest pastimes we have is the ancestor of the TV, film and theater. The shadows of our hands can create fantastic worlds. We just need a light source and our imagination.</p>

			<p><strong>Shadow Game</strong> records and retains the shadows we do over it and returns immediately or after a while. We can then play with the shadows that made other players who played before while we record new shadows to play with that will come later.</p>
			<p>This remind us that when we play time does not matter.</p>
			<p>This game is part of a bigest project call <strong>"La Mesa del Tiempo"</strong> was designed especially for the Toy Museum of San Isidro, seeks to deploy the technological dimension of the current game, find points of intersection between technology, gaming and community.</p>
			<p>This project has the dual purpose of keeping alive various ansient games, rescuing and preserving them as intangible heritage through a new medium of art, where it re-contextualized in a reality closer to the children of today.</p>
			<p>This will allow a meeting between two different generations, celebrating the ritual of playing with others.</p>
