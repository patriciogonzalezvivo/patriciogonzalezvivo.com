Astros is a living, luminous meditation on the present sky. An ever-changing translation of astrological data into light and form. Drawing from real-time celestial positions, the work renders the cosmos as it is now, transforming astronomical precision into a poetic visual language.

Astros bridges ancient cosmology and contemporary computation, inviting the viewer to contemplate time, alignment, and presence. It is not a representation of the sky as myth, but as a living condition, measured, translated, and momentarily held in light.
