			<p>Assistant Teacher of the Course <a href="http://www.nrogers.com/ccexcerpt.html" target="_blank"><i>Creative Connexión®</i></a>  at Performant Arts School of the Universidad del Salvador. That was an incredible space to explore the connections and possibilities of the different artistic languages on the personal journey of each student. (The Creative Connection® technique was developed by Natalie Rogers and brought to Argentina by Graciela Bottini)</p>
      		<p>Above you can see a video of the students dancing and performing to explore their own creative process by means of the joyOfLight application.</p>
