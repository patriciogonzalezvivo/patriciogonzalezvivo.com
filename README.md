**Patricio Gonzalez Vivo** is an artist and engineer who uses code and light to turn data into stunning landscapes. His landscapes address the problem of scale and the development of technology to perceive beyond the world in front of us. This technology helps us to see where our eyes are otherwise blind, pushing our cognitive limits. Patricio’s landscapes are not just representations of space but compositions of time and perception. Although his work is technically sophisticated his process is driven by curiosity and playful tinkering. Binoculars, telescopes, astrolabes, compasses, grids, maps, and photographs are some of the apparatus that trigger his imagination. 

Patricio’s work has been shown at [FILE Festival](http://file.org.br/) (2012, 2013), [Espacio Fundación Telefónica](http://espacio.fundaciontelefonica.com/), and [FASE](http://encuentrofase.com.ar/). He was a MediaLab resident at Centro Cultural Español. Patricio currently makes open source mapping tools at [Mapzen](http://mapzen.com). His work has been featured in [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/), [The Atlantic](http://www.citylab.com/), and [Fast Company](http://www.fastcompany.com/). He developed visual systems for the interactive [Clouds documentary](http://cloudsdocumentary.com/). He teaches at [Parsons The New School](http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/mfa-design-technology/), where he received his MFA in Design and Technology.

Patricio lives in Brooklyn and Buenos Aires. In his previous life he was a clinical psychologist and art therapist. He believes in developing a better together.
