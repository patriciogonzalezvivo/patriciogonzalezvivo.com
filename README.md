**Patricio Gonzalez Vivo** is a digital alchemist who creates artifacts of contemplation about time and space. Although his medium is primarily light, his work combines technical skills in wood, metal, electricity, and code. Because of this liminal nature, his artifacts share qualities with maps, clocks, and optical lenses.

As part of his art practice, Patricio makes tools, frameworks, and educational materials that he shares. Tool making is central to his art practice as a way to spread ideas and give back to his community. His  [Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/)  has taught to an entire generation of digital artists; the book has been used for countless workshops and inspired several other projects. His tools [GlslViewer](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslViewer), [glslCanvas](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslCanvas), [glslEditor](http://editor.thebookofshaders.com/) and libraries like [Lygia](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/lygia), [Hilma](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/hilma), [Hypatia](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/hypatia) and [Ada](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/ada), are widely used as reliable instruments for art making.

Patricio has been invited to show his work to [EYEO](http://eyeofestival.com/), [Resonate](http://resonate.io/), [GROW](https://www.grow.paris/), [FILE](http://file.org.br/), [Espacio Fundación Telefónica](http://espacio.fundaciontelefonica.com/), and [FASE](http://encuentrofase.com.ar/) festivals, to talk about his work at [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/zachl/overview/) and at [Carnegie Mellon University, Frank-Ratche Studio for Creative Inquiry](https://www.cmu.edu/cfa/studio/).
