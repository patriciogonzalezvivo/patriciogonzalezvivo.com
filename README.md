**Patricio Gonzalez Vivo** (Buenos Aires, 1982) is a multidisciplinary artist whose practice spans traditional and digital media. Now based in the United States, he explores awareness, perception, and self-discovery through motifs such as celestial bodies, esoteric symbolism, temporal systems, and cartographic forms. His work weaves together the poetic and the procedural, revealing hidden structures behind the ways we measure and make sense of the world.

A defining aspect of Patricio’s practice is the creation of his own tools, libraries, and pedagogical resources, which he releases openly. For him, toolmaking is both an artistic method and a form of community stewardship—an act of sharing knowledge and expanding access to creative technologies. His [Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/) has shaped an entire generation of digital artists, serving as a cornerstone for workshops, courses, and derivative projects around the world. His tools —[GlslViewer](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslViewer), [glslCanvas](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslCanvas) and [glslPipeline](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glsl-pipeline/)— and libraries such as [Lygia](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/lygia), [Vera](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/vera), [Berthe](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/berthe), and [Hypatia](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/hypatia) are widely used as reliable instruments for artistic experimentation and production.
