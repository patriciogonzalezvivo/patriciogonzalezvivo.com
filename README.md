**Patricio Gonzalez Vivo**, born in Buenos Aires in 1982 and currently based in the United States, is a multidisciplinary artist working across traditional and digital mediums. In his work, he pursues awareness and self-discovery through themes like celestial bodies, esoteric symbolism, clocks and maps.

As part of his art practice, Patricio makes his own tools, libraries, and educational materials that he shares openly. Tool making is central to his art practice as a way to spread ideas and give back to his community. His  [Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/)  has taught to an entire generation of digital artists; the book has been used for countless workshops and inspired several other projects. His tools [GlslViewer](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslViewer), [glslCanvas](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslCanvas) and [glslPipeline](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glsl-pipeline/) and libraries like [Lygia](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/lygia), [Vera](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/vera), [Berthe](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/berthe), and [Hypatia](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/hypatia), are widely used as reliable instruments for art making.
