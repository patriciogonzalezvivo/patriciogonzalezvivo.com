			<p>The goal of this project is to expose the nature of our relationship with our environment. Reviewing the history of optical devices and the intentionality of their design, we reveal a hidden modus operandi behind their technical construction. Also we will explore and deconstruct how we perceive nature. By reviewing the history of the design of optical devices, we will see a hidden pattern of power and control.</p>
