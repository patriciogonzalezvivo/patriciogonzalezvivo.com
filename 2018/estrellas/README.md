Stars, our silent witness, had teach us about: cycles, location and transcendence. We gave them names, we group them into shapes, we tell stories about them. 

This artwork is a windows to the starry sky. Shows the precise position of the stars and other heavenly bodies (such us the sun, our moon and the planets of our solar system) at the current time. Bring back the awareness of the cosmos to our urban life. 

This work is a reminiscence of an era when we knew how to read the sky for answers presented as the silent landscape of all experience, as an omnipresent iris, a door to discovery that ultimately force us to look our selfs.
