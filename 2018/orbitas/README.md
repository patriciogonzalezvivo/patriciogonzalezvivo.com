Confined by narrow thresholds, our perception is tuned to a particular scale on time and space. Everything above or under requires the use of tools and artifacts. 

This minimalist work, it's a realtime simulation that explores the patterns generated by planets and satellites. The astrodynamics involve make generative compositions over time while an imaginary camera orbit around our solar system. 

Together with LUNA, this work it's a clock, a calendar, a glimpse of the bigger picture.
