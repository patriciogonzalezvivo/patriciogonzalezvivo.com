This body of video work explores the relationship between time, perception, and emotional states.

By integrating machine-learning techniques, including optical flow inference and depth estimation, with real-time shader manipulation, the series produces temporally distorted images in which duration appears to liquefy, accumulate, and collapse. The resulting works function as emotional studies, proposing time as a plastic medium shaped by sensation, memory, and affect.
